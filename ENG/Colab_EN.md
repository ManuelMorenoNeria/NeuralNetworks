# Google Colab
![1_HQu1ItNzJMwXd57SnF6DwA](https://github.com/ManuelMorenoNeria/NeuralNetworks/assets/114908218/e5f9eef0-4b75-46b1-b420-be41f61e7c65)

In this project, we will be using Google Colab as our primary platform for developing TensorFlow and Keras models.

### What is Google Colab?
It is a cloud platform that provides a Jupyter Notebook-based development environment, allowing us to write and execute Python code interactively.

## Advantages of Google Colab
- **Access to resources:** Google Colab provides free access to computing resources such as GPU and TPU, which can significantly accelerate the training of machine learning models.
- **Pre-configured environment:** Google Colab comes pre-installed with all the necessary libraries for developing TensorFlow and Keras models.
- **Collaboration and sharing:** We can easily share our Colab notebooks with other collaborators.

## Local Usage
Although we will be using Google Colab as our primary platform, it is worth noting that TensorFlow and Keras models can also be developed in local environments.

To replicate the environment locally, we would need to install the following:

- Windows, Mac OS, or Linux operating system (recommended)
- Python (latest version)
- Python development environment: Anaconda
- TensorFlow
