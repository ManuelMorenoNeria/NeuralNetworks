# What are neural networks?

They are **structures** inspired by the functioning of the **human brain**.

They are made up of units called **neurons**, arranged in interconnected layers. These layers include:

- **Input layer:** Receives the input data and transmits it through the neural network.
- **Hidden layers:** Intermediate layers that process information through calculations carried out by neurons.
- **Output layer:** Produces the final result of the neural network.

Each neuron in a neural network has three main elements:

- **Weights:** They are numerical values ​​that indicate the importance of the inputs for the neuron.
- **Weighted sum:** Each neuron calculates the weighted sum of the inputs multiplied by their weights.
- **Activation function:** Determines whether a neuron is activated or not based on its weighted sum.

During training, the neural network automatically adjusts the weights of each neuron to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. This process is done using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent.
