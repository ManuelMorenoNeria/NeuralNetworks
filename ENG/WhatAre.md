They are **structures** formed by a set of interconnected neurons inspired by the functioning of the **human brain**.

Let's start with the basics, **What is a neuron?**

A neuron in a neural network is a processing unit, that is, a set of mathematical operations performed on the input to obtain the output.

Each neuron in a neural network has three main elements:

- **Weights:** Numerical values that indicate the importance of the inputs to the neuron.
- **Weighted sum:** Each neuron calculates the weighted sum of the inputs multiplied by their weights.
- **Activation function:** Determines whether a neuron is activated or not based on its weighted sum.

During training, the neural network automatically adjusts the weights of each neuron to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. This process is performed using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent.

They are composed of **neurons**, arranged in interconnected layers. These layers include:

- **Input layer:** Receives the input data and transmits it through the neural network.
- **Hidden layers:** Intermediate layers that process the information through calculations performed by the neurons.
- **Output layer:** Produces the final result of the neural network.
