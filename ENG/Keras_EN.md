Keras is an open-source Neural Networks library written in Python. It is capable of running on TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, or Theano.

It is specially designed to enable experimentation with Deep Learning networks in a relatively short amount of time.

## Features of Keras:
- **Ease of use:** Intuitive and consistent interface
- **Modularity:** Easy experimentation and customization of the network architecture.
- **Compatibility with TensorFlow and other backends:** Seamless integration with TensorFlow for optimal performance.
- **Wide range of layers and activation functions:** Offers a variety of predefined layers.

## Applications and Uses
- **Research in deep learning**
- **Development of artificial intelligence products**
- **Education and teaching**
- **Medical research**

## Advantages of Keras
- **Simplicity:** Easy to learn and use.
- **Flexibility:** Allows experimentation with different network architectures.
- **Compatibility:** Easily integrates with other deep learning frameworks.
- **Wide adoption:** Used in a variety of fields, from research to industry.
