## History
The beginnings of TensorFlow date back to 2011 when Google Brain developed DistBelief as a machine learning system, based on deep learning neural networks.

Due to its rapid growth, Google aimed to simplify and rebuild the source code of DistBelief into a faster and more robust application-grade library, resulting in TensorFlow.
