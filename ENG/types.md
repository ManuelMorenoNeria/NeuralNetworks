**Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN):** Also known as dense neural networks, they are the most basic type of neural network. In these networks, information flows in a single direction, from inputs to outputs, without cycles or feedback.

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** These networks are designed to process sequences of data, where the output at a given time depends on previous inputs and the network's internal memory. They are useful for tasks such as natural language processing, machine translation, speech recognition, among others.

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** They are highly effective for image classification and object detection. They use convolutional layers to extract important features from input images and pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN):** Consist of two neural networks pitted against each other: the generator and the discriminator. The generator tries to create realistic samples of data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated samples.
